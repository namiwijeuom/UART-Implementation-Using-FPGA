# UART-Implementation-Using-FPGA
This is a group assignment done under the module EN2111 Electronic Circuit Design, Semester 4, Department of Electronic &amp; Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

The task description of the assignment is as follows.
1. Find a Verilog RTL for UART Transceiver.
2. Develop a testbench.
3. Implement your RTL design in FPGA and verify the operation with another group using 7segment displays.
4. Take a snapshot of your FPGA with oscilloscope showing the waveform.
